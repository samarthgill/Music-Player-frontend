# spotify-frontend
Your Spotify clone project is shaping up well! You’ve implemented core features like song playback, progress tracking, volume control, and the ability to add new songs dynamically. Here are a few potential improvements you might consider:

UI Enhancements: Make the design more visually appealing using CSS  or grid for better alignment.
Search Functionality: Improve the search bar to filter songs dynamically as the user types.
Local Storage Integration: Save added songs so they persist after refreshing the page.
Playlist Feature: Allow users to create and manage playlists.
Better Play/Pause Handling: Update the play button icon dynamically when a song is playing or paused.
# Tool used HTML,CSS,JS.
